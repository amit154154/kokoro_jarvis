# Kokoro Fine-Tuning and Experimentation

This project is an ongoing **research and experimentation framework** around [Kokoro](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) â€” a super small, efficient text-to-speech (TTS) model.  
The focus is on **fine-tuning**, **optimizing and exploring voice embeddings**, and investigating future directions for adapting Kokoro to new speakers, styles, and research applications.

## Optimizing Kokoro Voices

The goal is to optimize voice embeddings for a dataset consisting of WAV files and their corresponding transcripts.  
I explore two optimization strategies:

### Small Adjustments

This method optimizes a **low-dimensional vector of coefficients** over existing Kokoro voice embeddings.  
The coefficients act as mixing weights, combining multiple pretrained voices into a new embedding.  
This provides a lightweight way to adapt Kokoro to a target voice without fully retraining the model.
